                    Being mentored by IITH, IIITR has adopted the innovative
                    fractal academics system, which warrants continuous
                    evaluation. This ensures the students have a deeper
                    understanding of the core subjects. Moreover, the highly
                    flexible curriculum forged by the esteemed faculty of IITH and
                    IIITR exuberates innovation and inventiveness. With core
                    subjects being incorporated from the first semester itself, the
                    students are able to finish their courses quite early and focus
                    on developing projects & industry relevant skills.
